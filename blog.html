        <h2>Oculus Rift S vs Valve Index</h2>
        <h5>Oct 26 2020</h5>
		<br>
        <p class="text-left"> Consumer virtual reality devices are a relatively new thing, but as time goes on, more and more of these devices are released. Out of all of these devices, there are two that I have tried: the Oculus Rift S and the Valve Index. Both of these devices have their own pros and cons, but is one objectively better than the other? Is the Index worth over double the price? Spoilers, the answer is yes, but not necessarily because of the technology itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-left"> I first started my VR adventures with the Oculus Rift S. Like any VR device, it can be used for a variety of entertainment and experiences, usually for games or social interactions. This is also the first, and so far only device, I have tried developing for. The headset works extremely well, with great controller tracking despite the lack of any kind of camera or external sensors. As for the display, it looks decent and gets the job done, but can use definite improvement as the technology advances. The controllers are fantastic; lightweight and easy to use. However, there is no way to charge them, so you're either going to need your own rechargable AA's or a huge pack of disposable ones, because they use up battery very quickly. Finally there's the software, which is nice and easy to use. Oculus automatically starts its software when you put on the headset, which is a very handy feature. Inside that software you have easy access to all your games and virtual desktop, which I've found important when working with VR. You also get a virtual home to decorate and play in, which I have found much better than Valve's. However, Oculus' software comes with a lot of setbacks. Any games you buy on the Oculus store can only be played with an Oculus headset by default, so if you ever get a differnt headset you'll have to re-buy your games, unless you can find a third-party way to get them working. Just recently, Oculus has also required Facebook accounts to be able to use any part of the device - a bit worrying in terms of privacy when you have an account with your real name and information tied to a device with multiple cameras and microphones. Worst of all, you can lose all your purchases and your ability to use your heaset if your facebook account is banned or deacitvated.</p>

        <p class="text-left"> The Valve Index released only a couple of months after the Oculus Rift S with a much larger price-point of $999. While the headset itself is much higher quality than the Oculus Rift S, the most significant difference to me is with the controllers. These controllers strap to your hand in a way that allows for completely free use of your hands and fingers. While the Oculus controllers must be grabbed and held at all times, the Index controllers allow you to grab and throw virtual objects in the same way you would in reality, which leads to a much more immersive and fun experience. Unfortunately there are very few games which take advantage of this free motion, but it allows for huge potential for the future of VR and what new experiences could come if this technology becomes the standard. The other parts of the hardware are just as high of quality; the display looks much better than the Oculus and it's all comfortable. Unfortunately the software isn't quite as good, requiring it to be opened before putting on the headset, along with the menus being a bit more clunky and the default virtual home not as interesting. That said, access to the full Steam store allows for many more options when it comes to games, and Steam's infamous game sales and discounts. Hopefully future versions of the Valve Index will include internal sensors like Oculus to make the headset easier to set up and use.</p>

		<p class="text-left"> Overall, both of these headsets are really great. Obviously in terms of hardware, the Valve Index is much better, but it is also significantly more expensive. The Oculus Rift S would also be an easy recommendation if it weren't for the Facebook integration. Facebook will soon be completely required to use any Oculus device, and for those who refuse to use Facebook like myself, it makes it impossible to recommend getting one. Many Oculus users have already had their accounts banned and VR devices made useless after moving over to a Facebook account. With the sketchy practices of Facebook, I actively suggest not getting any kind of Oculus device and grabbing a Valve Index or other headset instead. If the Index is too expensive for you, it may just be better to wait for newer headsets to come out instead. There's many ways the technology hasn't reached its potential, and neither have the games and experiences that are out. The Index really shows the potential for where VR will go in the future and it's exciting to think about where it will end up. Let's just hope the practices Oculus and Facebook are implementing don't become the norm.</p>

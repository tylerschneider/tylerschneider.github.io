	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<hr>
	<p class="main-content">Hello, I'm Tyler Schneider! I'm a graduate of Boise State's Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology program. I love just about every aspect of game design from art to programming, but my favorite is creating enviornment art. My work is primarily done in Unity, Blender, and Adobe/Substance products, but I love to learn new programs and languages. In my free time, I enjoy playing games on Nintendo and PC, and working on my own personal projects and art!</p>
